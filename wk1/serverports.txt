1. What is the definition of server port?
- Communication endpoints, physical or wireless connections through hardware devices. In the context of software, it is a logical construct that identifies a network service (ports are identified through an address combination by 16 bit numbers which is known as a port number).
- Common protocols that use port numbers are Transmission Control Protocol and User Datagram Protocol. Port numbers are always associated to IP addresses 

2. What is server port range?
- There are two types of ports, registered ports (range 1024 - 49151) are used by vendors for hosting their applications. Dynamic ports (49152 - 65535) are used for temporary or private ports

3.How many bits does number above represent?
- Dynamic ports: 65535 =(2^16-1)= 15 bits
- Registered ports: 1023 = (2^10 -1 ) = 9 bits

4.State 10 common server ports
- HTTP 80, HTTPS 443, FTP 20,21..., SSH 22, SMTP 25, IMAP 143, MySQL 3306, cPanel 2082, WHM 2083, POP3 110
